					<h3>The Biggest New Domains to Hit the Internet Are Here!</h3>
					<p>
						The first round of new domain extensions (also called new TLDs) are already live, and more will launch every week.
					</p>
					<p>
						For soon-to-be-released domains, Domain.com offers Pre-Registration for General Availability. Pre-registering a domain gives you a better chance of securing the name you want. The new domains will be popular, so we recommend pre-registering. Get started by entering a domain or keyword in the search box above.
