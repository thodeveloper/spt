It boasts 135 million daily visitors, has more traffic than LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube combined, and is only second to Facebook in driving users to a company’s website. &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-leverage-pinterest-for-your-online-store/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest is a social media platform on the rise for online businesses. It boasts 135 million daily visitors, has more traffic than LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube combined, and is only second to Facebook in driving users to a company’s website.</p>
<p>To encourage more companies to use its platform, Pinterest introduced business accounts with powerful analytics that track impressions, repins and clicks. Whether you are a Pinning master or just a newbie, we’re showing you how to leverage Pinterest for your online store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18315" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18314"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">What is Pinterest?</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://business.pinterest.com/en" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, they are “a visual discovery tool that you can use to find ideas for all your projects and interests.” In laymen terms, it’s a digital and social corkboard. Users (or in Pinterest speak, pinners) can collect (or pin) images onto curated web pages called boards. The social aspect comes into play when other pinners reuse those images by repining them onto their personal boards. Now that you’ve mastered the Pinterest language, the next step in leveraging Pinterest is with a great strategy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Define your Audience and Message</span></h2>
<p>The key to a successful strategy is knowing who you’re talking to and what you are trying to say. Pinterest users generally fall within one of these <a href="http://sociable360.blogspot.com/2012/02/pinterest-demographic-data-marketers.html" target="_blank">demographics</a>: <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/25/pinterest-user-demographics/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank">female, 25+ years old and live in a suburban area</a>. If your customers fall into one of these categories, you should already be on Pinterest. If you want to target that demographic, you should also start pinning.</p>
<p>Now that you know who you’re talking to, figure out your message and how you want to deliver it. The power behind Pinterest is the ability to compile different images and ideas to convey a brand lifestyle. Be sure your voice, message, and overall content mirrors the lifestyle you promote.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">6 Ecommerce Rules for Pinterest</span></h2>
<p>Although you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pinterest/pinterest-for-business/" target="_blank">set up your business Pinterest account</a>, you’re not quite ready to start pinning. First, we need to lay down some ground rules to maximize the effectiveness of your pins.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use relevant # to promote your pins.</li>
<li>Create your boards with a combination of original pins and repins</li>
<li>Pin at night, with peak pins at 9:00PM</li>
<li>Select images that are long because they work best with Pinterest’s layout.</li>
<li>Allows customers to easily share your products with a Pinterest Share button (a native feature in PrestaShop.)</li>
<li>Stay active. Repin, comment, or simply like other Pinner’s content to engage other pinners.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Original Content on Pinterest</span></h2>
<p>Start creating your Pinterest business profile with this image size cheat sheet from <a href="http://www.authormedia.com/the-pinterest-cheat-sheet-to-image-sizes/" target="_blank">AuthorMedia</a>.</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Profile images: 165 x 165 pixels (scaled from 600 X 600 pixels)</li>
<li>Pins in feed: 238 pixels x adjusted to height</li>
<li>Expanded pin size: 735 pixels x adjusted to height</li>
<li>Cover image: 217 x 146 pixels</li>
<li>Tiny thumbnails: 51 x 51 pixels</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Next, brand original images with a watermark that includes your online shop’s web address. Don’t put it on everything, just on beautiful location shots featuring multiple products. When you pin product images from your website, always link them directly to the product for effortless shopping. Finally, write good descriptions &#8211; do not use product SKU’s or files names like IMG_21231.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Ideas for Stunning Pinterest Boards</span></h2>
<p>Get started with these 5 ideas and examples of Pinterest boards.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">1. Products</span></h4>
<p>Use a “Featured Products” or “What’s new” board to keep customers updated about your products. <a href="http://www.gretelhome.com/" target="_blank">Gretel Home</a>, a PrestaShop housewares shop, promotes their products with a <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/gretelhome/new-at-gretel/" target="_blank">New at Gretel board</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18318" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-1-gretel-home.png" alt="" width="540" height="255" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">2. Inspiration</span></h4>
<p>What inspires you? Do you work with cool patterns or trendy muses?<a href="http://www.whatgoesaroundnyc.com/" target="_blank"> What Goes Around Comes Around NYC</a> is a PrestaShop powered, luxury goods reseller and they’ve curated some <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/wgacany/vintage-luxury-ads/" target="_blank">Vintage Luxury Ads</a> to inspire their own photo shoots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18319" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-2-wgaca.png" alt="" width="540" height="244" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">3. Color(s)</span></h4>
<p>Pinterest is very visual so use that to your advantage by curating an entire Pinterest board dedicated to color. Choose one color, two complimentary colors, or even a rainbow. Check out PrestaShop-powered <a href="http://www.condura.com.au" target="_blank">Condura’s </a><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/condura/black-white/" target="_blank">Black &amp; White board</a> for some mod-inspiration</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18320" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-3-condura.png" alt="" width="540" height="225" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">4. Collaboration</span></h4>
<p>Ask customers to help contribute to your Pinterest boards. We recently asked our merchants to submit their gorgeous PrestaShop storefronts with #ShopShot. Those shops are now curated on our <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/prestashop/of-pride-and-stores/" target="_blank">Of Pride and Stores</a> Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18321" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-4-prestashop.png" alt="" width="540" height="206" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">5. Season or Holiday</span></h4>
<p>Keep your pins current with seasons and holidays. As summer comes to an end, pin some ideas for last minute summer activities or look forward new accessories for fall. Last year<a href="https://www.donnawilson.com/" target="_blank"> Donna Wilson</a>, a PrestaShop merchant selling hand-knit goods, created a <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/donnawilsonltd/donna-wilson-christmas-gift-guide-2013/" target="_blank">Christmas Gift Guide</a> with the perfect gifts ideas for mum, dad and even your best friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18322" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-5-donna-wilson.png" alt="" width="600" height="270" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>As with all strategy, analyze your performance to measure its effectiveness. Doing so will ensure you are getting the most of your Pinterest Business Account.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, blogging has proved to be the most effective inbound marketing method for online businesses. Ecommerce sites that blog successfully are driving more relevant traffic, increasing brand awareness and creating shareable content.</p>
<p>This complete introduction to ecommerce blogging will share the fundamentals of creating a great blog and examples of online businesses that are doing it right.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18293" title="header-ecommerce-blogging" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/header-ecommerce-blogging-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18264"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Benefits of Blogging for Ecommerce</span></h2>
<p>Too many online retailers focus solely on marketing tactics that convert visitors into direct sales like discounts and promotions. And yet, blogging isn’t about converting customers right away. It’s about engaging potential customers with valuable, relevant content.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Why you should blog for your business:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Appealing to your target audience<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Driving qualified traffic<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Promoting products without being salesy<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Building credibility as an expert<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Generating leads by instilling trust<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Enabling readers to share content</p>
<p>Now, how do you create a successful blog that lets you reap all of those benefits?</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Defining Buyer Personas</span></h2>
<p>An ecommerce blog is a great medium for generating traffic but savvy business owners know that tons of traffic doesn’t always mean tons of sales. You should write content that appeals to your buyer personas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18298" title="Buyer Persona" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/Buyer-Persona.png" alt="" width="540" height="236" /></p>
<p>Buyer personas are a crucial step to be able to write killer content for your blog. That’s why you should ask yourself these <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30907/9-Questions-You-Need-to-Ask-When-Developing-Buyer-Personas.aspx" target="_blank">9 questions when developing your buyer personas</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve defined your customers, you’ll find it much easier to make a return on your blogging efforts and create the ultimate content strategy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Creating a Content Strategy</span></h2>
<p>A content strategy will determine the type of content, tone, topics and information you’ll publish to engage prospective buyers.</p>
<p>Because buyer personas play such a large role when developing a content strategy, there isn’t one approach that works for every ecommerce blog. However, there are best practices that are working for many successful businesses regardless of what they are selling.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Engaging blog content ideas for inspiration:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> How-to videos<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Photo heavy content<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Do it yourself articles<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Outfit inspiration<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Holiday gift ideas<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Interviews with celebrated leaders<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Review or predict trends<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Showcase your team, office, etc<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Review related services, products, events</p>
<p>Always remember that your blog should build trust, provide information and increase brand awareness with content that converts readers and/or keeps them coming back for more.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Building an Editorial Calendar</span></h2>
<p>Every active blog has an editorial calendar running behind the scenes. A monthly editorial calendar is a document that manages the planning, creation and publishing of blog posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18299" title="EDITORIAL CALENDAR" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/EDITORIAL-CALENDAR.png" alt="" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">A comprehensive editorial calendar includes:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Publish Date:</strong></span> That’s pretty self explanatory but make sure you consider holidays, days of the week and timing. This article covers the <a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2011/06/10/whats-the-best-day-and-time-to-publish-content/  " target="_blank">best days and times to publish content</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Title:</strong></span> Blog post titles should be SEO-friendly but most importantly, they should tempt your buyer persona to read.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>SEO Keywords:</strong></span> These are the keywords you want to use throughout the blog post to rank higher on search engines. Here are <a href="http://writtent.com/blog/14-blog-writing-tips-for-creating-seo-friendly-blog-posts/ " target="_blank">14 tips for writing SEO-friendly blog posts</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Call to Action:</strong></span> Every blog post should have a clear call to action. What exactly do you want your readers to do after reading this post? Like your Facebook page, view a product, watch a video?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Channels for Promotion:</strong></span> How will you promote this blog post to readers? For example, you might share the blog post on social networks or in your monthly newsletter.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Bootstrap is no longer a buzzword in web-design. It has become a full-fledged action verb. “Are you having trouble starting your web-design project? Just Bootstrap it.” When a brand name like Twitter Bootstrap becomes an informal everyday word, you know that people like it and that people use it, a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">In the likes Xerox for photocopying, and Google for online searching, Bootstrap has essentially become the go-to framework for designing websites. That may be a bit of a bold statement given the number of competitors in the market, but hear me out. In my previous post, I gave <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/what-is-bootstrap/">a brief history of the unlikely birth and explosive hype</a> surrounding the Twitter Bootstrap framework.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look into 5 reasons why Bootstrap has matched the hype.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18251" title="img-02" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/img-02.png" alt="" width="500" height="150" /><span id="more-18245"></span></p>
<h4>1. Time Saver:</h4>
<p>Bootstrap comes equipped with pre-made grids, patterns, and ready-to-go CSS and HTML style elements like tables, forms, buttons, icons etc. What does this mean for the busy web-designer? It means that you literally have everything you need to create a professional looking website from scratch, all with one package of Bootstrap. Gone are the days where you have to style and code every element of your webpage, just Bootstrap it.</p>
<h4>2. Fully Responsive:</h4>
<p>Nearly all websites need to be mobile ready and responsive, especially ecommerce websites. You want your visitors to be able to browse products on a desktop at home, add products on their tablet while waiting to board a plane, and complete checkout on their smartphone after landing. It happens more and more each day as the power of mobile design and mobile payments evolve. Bootstrap comes ready with a variety of responsive grids to service every level of mobile ready design.</p>
<h4>3. Active Community:</h4>
<p>To date, <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap’s GitHub repository</a> has 70,000 stars (which equate to Facebook likes, or Google +1’s). It also has nearly 600 contributors making it one of the most popular repositories on GitHub. You can be sure that if you ever have a problem, concern or question, simply post the question on GitHub Bootstrap threads and interact with the experts. Chances are, your question has been answered already. It’s good to know the community has got your back.</p>
<h4>4. JavaScript Plugin Bundles:</h4>
<p>One of Bootstrap’s greatest features is that it comes pre-bundled with a variety of useful JavaScript plugins. Every designer knows the headache that can come with compatibility between JavaScript functions and your web-design. Fortunately, all of Bootstraps pre-bundled JS plugins work flawlessly. Do you need animated tabs, moving sliders and collapsible menus? Just Bootstrap it.</p>
<h4>5. Docs. Docs. Docs:</h4>
<p>One can never underestimate the power of good documentation. Bootstrap is heralded around the web-design world for having extensive, helpful and easy-to-read documentation. They provide examples of nearly every element. I can’t forget to mention that it also includes a demo that makes it even more accessible for the beginner web-designer. From the easiest functions to the most complex elements, the Bootstrap documentation covers all bases.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Bootstrap exploded through the web-design scene and it’s no surprise why. The combination of ready-made elements, bundled animations, extensive documentation and a passionate community make the Twitter Bootstrap framework an attractive solution for all levels of web-design. That’s not to say you’ll have your dream website in a snap, you still must have a pretty good knowledge of HTML and CSS to really get started. If you haven’t seen it already, we were fortunate enough to interview the creator of Bootstrap, Mark Otto. You can <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/creator-of-bootstrap-mark-otto-speaks-to-attendees-at-prestashop-barcamp-2013/">check out the full video here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading all about this awesome Framework, be sure to comment below. Finally, I’ll leave you with one question. Do you Bootstrap?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A clear and comprehensive return policy reinforces credibility and is crucial for building customer trust. As an online merchant, a return policy helps you reduce the time spent on refunds, address customer concerns and increase profitability. So what should it include and where should you start? We’ll help you get going by exploring the anatomy of ecommerce return policies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18240" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/Return-Policies.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<h2><span id="more-18224"></span><span style="color: #ff7d2f; font-weight: bold;">What can be returned?</span></h2>
<p>The first decision you have to make is whether or not you want to accept returns or exchanges. Not sure? Here are 5 product categories that are generally not accepted for returns according to the <a href="http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/s-6.shtml" target="_blank">California Legal Guide.</a> Your local government should have similar documents available.</p>
<ol>
<li>Food, plants, flowers, and other perishable goods</li>
<li>Customized goods received as ordered</li>
<li>Goods which cannot be resold due to health considerations</li>
<li>Products returned in non-resalable condition</li>
<li>Returns without original tags, packaging and receipts or invoices</li>
</ol>
<p>If you sell an assortment of products, outline which items can or cannot be returned.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff7d2f;">Refund Amount</span></h2>
<p>List the refund amount customers can expect. For example, shipping fees are generally not refunded while taxes are. If you charge restocking fees, list them in your return policy as well. Customers should be able to calculate the exact amount they will receive.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff7d2f;">How much time?</span></h2>
<p>Specify the return period (in days or months), customers have to return their order. Not sure how much time is appropriate? Consider this key factor &#8211; payment processers store customers’ credit card information for a limited number of days. Without this, you will not be able to refund customers. Other factors to consider include the order delivery and return shipping times.</p>
<p>For a very clear return policy, we suggest indicating when the return period starts. Is it the day the purchase is made, orders ship, or customers receive the package? Also, include the activity that must be completed before that period ends. For example, do customers just have to ship their return or should you receive the package by the then. Finally, specify how many days it will take for your business to process the refund and keep customers updated by systematically updating their return status.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff7d2f;">Where should customers send returns?</span></h2>
<p>List the address return packages should be sent to and don’t forget to include the department. To help ensure customers ship to the right location, include a return slip customers can tape outside of their package.</p>
<p>You should also specify who pays for the postage. Having customers pay for the postage is cost effective, however, they may select a cheap and unreliable shipping service. Regardless of who pays, insure your product(s) with tracking services.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff7d2f;">What about exchanges?</span></h2>
<p>Can customers return an item for an exchange or store credit? If so, what is the process like for customers? How long will it take? Also, list any fees they will have to pay such as restocking fees or additional shipping charges. If you do not accept exchanges or offer store credit, clearly state so.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff7d2f;">Special situations:</span></h2>
<h4><strong>Sales</strong></h4>
<p>When retailers run sales, it can be assumed that those goods cannot be returned. However, this assumption varies from person to person, so explicitly state the applicable return policy for sales. For example, if you use language like “as is”, “all sales final”, “gifts with purchase”, or “BOGO (buy one get one free)”, clearly state it will not be accepted for refunds.</p>
<h4><strong>Past Due</strong></h4>
<p>Let customers know what happens if products are received past the return period. Will customers receive store credit, get a refund at a discounted amount, or will you simply return the item back? A strict return policy may protect you against losses, however, it may also dissuade customers from making purchases.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff7d2f;">Closing remarks</span></h2>
<p>Include a clause that lets you make reasonable changes or updates to the return policy at your discretion. As you learn more about your customers’ shopping habits, you can modify the return policy to better reflect their expectations. If you find that you receive too many returns, check out these <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/10-ways-to-reduce-returns-for-your-e-commerce-site/" target="_blank">10 ways to reduce returns</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we welcome Steve Chou, co-owner of Bumblebee Linens and MyWifeQuitHerJob.com. Within a year of launching, Steve’s online store &#8211; Bumblebee Linens &#8211; successfully netted over $100,000 in sales. Yes, that’s right – 6 figures in one year.</p>
<p>He then created MyWifeQuitHerJob.com to share expert tips and advice on running a successful online business. Today his blog reaches over 90,000 monthly readers and has been featured by <em>The New York Times </em>and <em>The</em> <em>Huffington Post</em>. We invited him to share expert advice with 4 essential tips to improving your on-site search engine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18199" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/search-improve5.png" alt="" width="540" height="284" /> <span id="more-18198"></span></p>
<p>If you run your own online store, you probably already know that optimizing for the search engines (especially Google) is essential if you want to drive more traffic to your web site and increase your sales. However, as important as it is to drive traffic to your web site, <strong>the real key is keeping visitors on your site </strong>&#8211; and encouraging them to buy.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18202" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/mywifequitherjob-headshot-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" align="right" /><br />
Unfortunately, too many online businesses focus so much on optimizing for the big search engines that they completely <strong>neglect their own web sites</strong>. After <a href="http://mywifequitherjob.com/how-to-open-an-online-store/" target="_blank">teaching ecommerce</a> and running my own online business selling handkerchiefs for many years now, I have learned the value of <strong>a good on-site search engine</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting fact. Most customers that land on my store home page don’t browse for the product they want. <strong>Instead, they head directly to the search bar to locate exactly what they want.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>If your site isn&#8217;t ready to handle those potential customers, you could lose thousands of dollars in business. In fact, the data indicates that more than <strong>95 percent of customers will leave a site immediately if the search doesn&#8217;t yield what they are looking for.</strong> One bad search, and that customer is gone &#8212; and so is your sale.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc883e">Out-Of-The-Box Search Solutions Are Not Good Enough</span></h4>
<p>If you blindly add products to your shopping cart database without taking into account your on-site search engine, then guess what? Your on-site search engine is going to suck.<br />
Not too long ago, I analyzed some of the search queries on my site that weren&#8217;t returning results for customers. Here were the results:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">handkie<br />
hankercheif<br />
women’s hankies<br />
mankerchief</p>
<p><strong>It’s pretty clear, when looking at these terms, why no results were returned.</strong> The first two of those are misspelled. The third features an apostrophe that would normally be stripped out of the search string, but wasn&#8217;t. The fourth is clearly an attempt to find a handkerchief for a man. All of these items are available in my online store. However, a customer wouldn&#8217;t realize this from the search results.</p>
<p>Most ecommerce platforms won’t offer you what you need for an effective search return by default. <strong>Misspellings and synonyms could be costing you thousands of dollars,</strong> and you might not even realize it. If you want a chance at retaining these would-be customers and converting them to sales, here are 4 things you need to start doing:</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc883e">1. Understand That Improving Your On-Site Search Engine Is Up To You</span></h4>
<p>It’s true that most of your customers are going to find your products through Google, landing directly on the product page or on a category page. However, even with this reality, there are likely many potential customers using your on-site search tool.</p>
<p>While you don’t need to create Google’s next competitor, you do have to create <strong>a localized search engine </strong>on your site for your own products. In other words, you will need to <strong>populate product specific search terms</strong> to help potential customers find relevant results that keep them on your site. Even if you need a little help from a web developer, it is usually worth the investment.</p>
<p>PrestaShop’s onsite search is already pretty good in that it offers auto-completion and search suggestions, but most of work in optimizing your own search engine is going to require work on your part.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc883e">2. Log All of Your Searches</span></h4>
<p>You will never be able to think of all the variations on your products. No matter how long you spend trying to pinpoint possible misspellings, syntax errors, punctuation mistakes, and other variations on your products, you will never think of them all. Searchers will constantly surprise you.</p>
<p>If you want a high-level view of what’s happening with search queries on your site, <strong>log them all</strong>. You can spot patterns and irregularities and adjust accordingly so that, even when searchers make mistakes, they will see results on the page. Here are the main things to watch for as you analyze the queries on your site:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Synonyms:</strong> Even if you have good product descriptions that provide alternative words for your merchandise, there is likely another word you haven’t heard of. Make note of those words and direct your on-site search to connect them to the appropriate products.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Plurals, apostrophes, and other punctuation: </strong>Make sure that your search strings strip punctuation marks and plurals. You can tinker with the code to make this happen so that errant grammar doesn&#8217;t doom your customers’ search results.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Contractions:</strong> Many searchers use slang and abbreviations when looking for specific products. Factor these into your search as well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Misspellings: </strong>People will always have trouble spelling. You need to make sure your on-site search takes that into account. Pay attention to “alternative” spellings and common typos so that you can return valid search results when customers make mistakes.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc883e">3. Allow Customers to Easily Refine Searches</span></h4>
<p>My store sells handkerchiefs. More than half of the products I sell are labeled “handkerchiefs.” This means that someone looking for “hankies” is likely to run into trouble with the search. Most customers aren&#8217;t going to stick around when they see the meager results. At the same time, it’s impractical for me to go back and add the search term “hankies” to all of those product search descriptions.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can use a little hack to get around that issue. Rather than displaying no results, or very limited results, you can <strong>include a new search link</strong> that asks the customer if s/he meant to look for something else. In my case, a search for “hankies” shows this message:</p>
<p><strong>Did you mean to search for “handkerchiefs”?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This method can be applied to a number of misspellings and other errors that surface in customer searches. It’s easy to make this link <strong>prominent and clickable </strong>so that customers have to put very little effort into changing up the search. They receive better results, and stay on your site rather than abandoning.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc883e">4. Add Search-Specific Keywords to Your Products</span></h4>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve analyzed what people are looking for, it’s time to <strong>add search-specific keywords to your products.</strong> These are keywords that might not appear in your product name or title, and may not appear in the product description. However, you want these products to be listed for certain popular search terms on your site.</p>
<p>“Mother of the bride” is a popular term on my site. However, we don’t want to title or describe hundreds of products using that term. So this term is <strong>included in the search terms</strong> associated with particular products. This association means that customers can find hundreds of suitable items when they search for “mother of the bride.”</p>
<p>The best way to go about this process is to<strong> add the search terms each time you add a new product. </strong>Make it part of the routine when you add products to avoid time-consuming mass updates. If you are in a position that requires mass updates, block out time to do it little by little, starting with the most popular terms.</p>
<p><em>Bottom Line<br />
</em>Your on-site search matters. If you don’t want to lose customers due to frustrating search results, you need to make the effort to improve your on-site search.</p>

<p>With all this great advice, where should you begin? If you’re a PrestaShop merchant, we’ve got you covered with:</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc883e">4 Steps to Get Started</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>1.</strong> Access and review keywords your customers have searched<br />
<em>         Back Office &gt; Stats &gt; Shop Search </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>2. </strong>Categorize each search word or phrase into<br />
<span style="color: #800080">          a. Misspellings or Synonyms</span><br />
<span style="color: #008000">          b. Attributes or Descriptions</span></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> For each word or phrase under the <span style="color: #800080">Misspelling or Synonyms</span> category, figure out which keyword(s) you would like to redirect customers to. Then create redirects for each word.<br />
<em>          Back Office &gt; Preferences &gt; Search</em></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> For each<span style="color: #008000"> Attribute or Description,</span> find products that fit those descriptions and add the keyword(s) as tags.<br />
