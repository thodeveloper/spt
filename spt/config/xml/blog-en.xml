			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://selfpackaging.com/" target="_blank">SelfPackaging </a>is a Spanish online store with an endless catalog of trendy DIY boxes. This online shop successfully applies the concept of “do it yourself” to the world of packaging, demonstrating that assembling your own gift boxes can be easy, cheap and fun! Best of all, you can place orders without outrageous prices, high minimums, or long processing times.</p>
<p>We met the talented SelfPackaging team at the eShow in Barcelona (Spain) then interviewed Eva Rodríguez, their Social Media Strategist, to see how they transformed SelfPackaging.es into a successful online store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18509" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/selfpackaging-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="341" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18508"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">What is SelfPackaging?</span></h4>
<p>SelfPackaging is, as its name suggests, is all about assembling product packaging by yourself. Our main products are boxes, which our entire store is dedicated to selling. With over 20 years of experience in the packaging industry, we have tons of designs that have been adapted to our customers’ needs.</p>
<p>We’ve also made our purchase process quick and easy with only 3 steps:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1. Select a box from the SelfPackaging catalog that matches your style and dimensions<br />
2. Customize the color of your boxes and add extras like tags or ribbons<br />
3. Wait for your boxes to arrive – ready to be assembled (Watch our tutorials for tips!)</p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">Tell us about yourself and the SelfPackaging team.</span></h4>
<p>Our online team is made up of Olga, who manages the Twitter and Facebook accounts for <a href="http://Selfpackaging.es" target="_blank">Selfpackaging.es</a>; Elisabeth, who is responsible for the social networks in English (<a href="http://www.selfpackaging.com/" target="_blank">selfpackaging.com</a>), Nuria, who manages the social networks in French (<a href="http://selfpackaging.fr" target="_blank">selfpackaging.fr</a>) and myself (Eva). I coordinate the marketing strategy and run the website with the help of our programming team.</p>
<p>The rest of the office is made up of Laura and Mireia (our box designers), the production workshop team and an external IT team.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">Did you have an online store before using PrestaShop?</span></h4>
<p>Yes we did, but it was a custom platform that had a number of limitations. Our main problem was that it did not allow us to scale our online store as our business grew.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">How and why did you choose PrestaShop?</span></h4>
<p>We chose PrestaShop because we needed an ecommerce platform that would allow us to customize our product management, yet was straightforward and easy to use. As [PrestaShop] is an open source platform, it allowed us to fully configure and adapt it to our products. We were also able to take advantage of the language features. In addition to selfpackaging.es, we have English and French versions of the site which we easily manage with PrestaShop.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18510" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/selfpackaging-2.png" alt="" width="550" height="522" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">What is your marketing strategy for your online store?</span></h4>
<p>I think that our main strengths lie in the customer service we provide and the community we have built through social media. We do this by managing social media in-house because nobody knows our products better than we do. It is how we’ve gained so many loyal followers!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18511" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/selfpackaging-3.png" alt="" width="550" height="349" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">How do you convert visitors into customers?</span></h4>
<p>Customer service is very important so we strive to make our customers’ lives easier. It is our goal to always provide good customer service. We listen to what [our customers] want and try to introduce products that addresses those needs &#8211; while making them as pretty and cheap as possible, of course!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #33cccc">What parts of the world do you sell your products?</span></h4>
<p>Our sales are mainly concentrated in Spain, although we recently opened websites for the United Kingdom and France. We’re continuing our expansion into the international market by launching an <a href="http://selfpackaging.it/" target="_blank">Italian version</a> of our website.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18512" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/selfpackaging-4.png" alt="" width="550" height="401" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, video marketing has become an increasingly important topic for online retailers. The rise in video content is largely tied to the limitations of flat product images. Since online shoppers can’t hold your products in their hands, video is an effective way to reassure customers and reduce returns.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the benefits, best practices and examples of video marketing for ecommerce.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18500" title="video-marketing" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/video-marketing-1024x537.png" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18390"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #028b6b;">Is video marketing worth the investment?</span></h2>
<p>A growing number of online retailers are starting to cash in on video marketing. According to a <a href="http://www.reelseo.com/consumers-purchase-video/ " target="_blank">recent study by ReelSEO</a>, 73% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase after watching a video. Additionally, 96% of the consumers surveyed said they found videos helpful making an online purchasing decision.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18499" title="ReelSEO Video Marketing Image" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/ReelSEO-Video-Marketing-Image.png" alt="" width="575" height="526" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Retail sites that make effective use of video benefit from:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><span style="color: #c902c5;"><strong> -</strong></span> Enhanced product display<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Increase in time spent on site<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Search engine optimization<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Lower return rates<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Increase in average cart value<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Improved conversion rates</p>
<h2><span style="color: #028b6b;">Best practices for ecommerce video marketing</span></h2>
<p>Videos are a great way to add “shopability” to your content, increasing engagement and conversions without distracting visitors from the buying process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>What type of videos work best for ecommerce?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><strong><span style="color: #c902c5;"> -</span></strong> Products in action<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Product demos<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Tutorials<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Explainer videos<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Video ads<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Corporate videos<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Video blogs<br />
<strong><span style="color: #c902c5;">-</span></strong> Testimonial videos</p>
<p>Now, I’ll show you 3 excellent examples of companies that use videos in the content marketing efforts.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #c902c5;">Products in action</span></h4>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Sh1Veb4xEi8" frameborder="0" width="400" height="225"></iframe></p>
<p>Zappos revealed that adding videos like this to their product pages increases sales between 6% and 30%. Notice how their simple 10-second video brings the product’s details to life.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #c902c5;">Product demos</span></h4>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k7xy8x8YlnE" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Walmart uses product demonstration videos to highlight details and features. They also upload these videos on their YouTube channel. This video alone has over 10,000 views to date.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #c902c5;">Corporate videos</span></h4>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/72730264?color=ff6346" frameborder="0" width="500" height="213"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.headict.co.uk/ " target="_blank">Headict</a>, a PrestaShop store, shares their corporate video directly on their homepage. It’s a great way to build a bond brand loyalty and connect customers to your brand.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #028b6b;">Optimizing videos for SEO</span></h2>
<p>Now more than ever, Google is ranking video content over other results. Integrating video content on product pages is an effective way to improve your search engine indexing. Also, we can’t forget that publishing videos on the second largest search engine in the world, Youtube, will help attract more traffic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Tuesday, after many months of hard work, we were thrilled to announce that our latest project, a revolutionary cloud ecommerce solution, was made available for Beta testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="PrestaShop Beta" href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/Home1.png" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-18486 aligncenter" title="Home Beta" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/Home1-1024x447.png" alt="PrestaShop Beta" width="584" height="254" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-18453"></span></p>
<p>What’s so special about this cloud ecommerce solution? Well, for starters, it’s completely free. That’s right folks, it’s pure unequivocal ecommerce freedom. We’ll never ask for your credit card to power your online store, ever. Not just for this Beta version, but all versions, forever! Just provide your email address and create your online store in minutes.</p>
<p>So many of you have already signed up to test the Beta version. The amount of feedback we’ve received so far is amazing and we’re happy you love it as much as we do.<br />
We know there are still many questions surrounding this upcoming release. We’ve made a quick list of the most common questions we’ve received so far, along with our answers. Here we go!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">How can we make our cloud solution totally free?</span></h4>
<p>The same way PrestaShop is completely free, through our trusted partnerships with industry leaders and the thousands of Addons extra features. These partnerships and Addons give you access to an arsenal of tools aimed at making your online store successful. It also allows PrestaShop to always remain free forever.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">The hosting is free… but is it efficient?</span></h4>
<p>We know that site speed and performance is key to maintaining a successful online store. That’s why we’ve teamed up with a powerhouse in quality hosting, OVH. You’re in good hands, OVH has over 700,000 customers worldwide, and their servers are equipped with the latest Intel processors and high performance SSD hard drives to ensure your store will be quick to take orders and make sales.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Is it a different software or version?</span></h4>
<p>Nope, it’s the same software and same version. PrestaShop is PrestaShop! Same engine, two ways to fire it up.<br />
Our cloud solution is already running off of the latest version of PrestaShop you know and love. When we update the downloadable version, we will also update our cloud solution. You will still be able to download PrestaShop and contributions made by developers from the Community on our Github branches will show on the PrestaShop software regardless of whether it was downloaded, hosted and installed manually, or set up in the cloud in one click!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">How can I test too?</span></h4>
<p>For now, our Beta site is available to a select number of users. However, we’ll open more slots in the upcoming days. Register on www.prestashop.com/en/beta and share on social networks to access the beta quicker.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Can I create a real store on this Beta?</span></h4>
<p>Yes! This new PrestaShop program is live and fully functional to start selling online. This new website is still in Beta in order to improve your experience as a user of PrestaShop. But the E-commerce software that will power your new online store is the PrestaShop 1.6 version you all know so well for already powering tens of thousands of online stores around the world. Knock yourself out! Create a real store and put it into production. Customize it, add modules and experiment! Your store will still be available even after the Beta phase. We are at your service to address any malfunctions on our feedback page.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">What’s the catch?</span></h4>
<p>There’s no catch! It’s completely free. PrestaShop is a very complete ecommerce solution with hundreds of online store features, available straight out of the box. You can add paid features and get premium paid support only if you want. Our mission is to give anyone, in any country around the world, the ability to open up a successful online store. We break the barriers to ecommerce!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">What are the customization possibilities of this cloud platform?</span></h4>
<p>Because you have access to template files, modules and overrides, you can fully customize a store, whether in terms of graphics or features. You can also personalize a store by using the modules and templates available through PrestaShop Addons.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Does this move towards the cloud mean you’ll end being open source?</span></h4>
<p>Absolutely not! PrestaShop is and always has been a free Open source project. This new program is another way to access PrestaShop. Open source is what our developers work on to make the PrestaShop solution available to everyone and PrestaShop’s code will always be Open source. Whether the software is hosted by you or in PrestaShop’s cloud, the code is the same. The PrestaShop Cloud solution reflects our ongoing desire to make e-commerce available to everyone by removing technical and financial barriers.<br />
The downloadable version of the solution will greatly benefit from the dynamic expansion of PrestaShop: like WordPress did for blogs, we put at the disposal of e-merchants and developers one unique software and two solutions to access it that meet different needs, without giving up on our core values: being free and Open source.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">What about Addons? Why does my module not show up in my Beta store?</span></h4>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, security and best practices, modules that can be installed in the hosted version of PrestaShop must be validated and marketed through PrestaShop Addons. This will make it easy for users to find all the extensions they want in one place. It is also a &#8220;mark of trust&#8221; that guarantees the modules work properly. In addition, it allows seamless modifications of your PrestaShop in the cloud for updates and so forth.</p>
<p>For developers, it’s also a good thing to offer their modules on Addons: it’s a seal of quality, and they definitely gain in visibility and sales being available on the official marketplace. If you usually develop for PrestaShop by following the guidelines in our documentation, your modules will work with our hosted solution. Remember to follow <a title="Module documentation PrestaShop" href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Creating+a+PrestaShop+Module" target="_blank">the module development rules</a> to be sure they will be fully compatible with all PrestaShop stores.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">What about web agencies and freelancers?</span></h4>
<p>Our hosted solution is not only great for merchants, but also for web agencies and freelancers. Indeed, you can extend your offer to smaller merchants and have a new package ready to sell.</p>
<p>PrestaShop’s hosted solution opens the door to e-commerce for merchants who have little or no technical knowledge because it allows them to get started in few minutes.<br />
This translates into a mass potential new clients in need of design, development, technical support and assistance services. As a skilled technician, you will be able to access the template files, modules and overrides.</p>
<p>Additionally, the unique nature of this groundbreaking ecommerce-in-the-cloud solution will boost PrestaShop&#8217;s brand image and, by extension, your status as an expert in the solution.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part our amazing open-source community. You’ve made it possible for us to make it happen! Through your ongoing support and loyalty we’ve grown to nearly 700,000 community members. You think we would ever forget our commitment to Open source? Never.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color: #99cc00;">&#8220;<em>Since day one, Open source has been part of PrestaShop’s DNA. Together with our remarkable community, we have built PrestaShop on a strong commitment to the accessibility, flexibility and lower cost benefits of Open source. As we continue to grow and innovate, we reaffirm that collaboration and openness remains at the core of every company endeavor.</em>&#8221; <strong>– Bruno Lévêque, Founder.</strong></p>
<p>This is just a taste of what’s to come. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us through our Uservoice page. Stay tuned for more updates when we reveal more about this revolutionary ecommerce in the cloud.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Why are product pages important? </strong></span></h3>
<p>Beyond SEO benefits, the goal of a product page is to convince visitors to make purchases. Product pages play the same role that a sales representative would in a traditional store. They provide two things for customers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">- </span>Information</strong>. Unlike a physical store, customers cannot touch or feel the product. Instead they rely on product pages to gain information like characteristics, features, benefits, etc.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong> </span><strong>Reassurance</strong>. Well-organized and complete product pages instill trust in the goods your sell so visitors won&#8217;t have reservations with placing orders.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Key elements of effective product pages</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong></span> Post customer reviews to give your products credibility.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong></span> Display product availability to avoid frustrating customers.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong></span> <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-importance-of-call-to-action-buttons-on-your-e-commerce-site/" target="_blank">Use a highly visible Call to Action button</a> with irresistible wording.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong> </span>Optimize load speed to avoid loosing visitors.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong> </span><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/diy-ecommerce-guide-to-gorgeous-product-photography/" target="_blank">Post quality images</a> that highlight the product from different angles.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong></span> Include product videos to provide important information to shoppers.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-</strong></span> <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/sell-more-online-8-tips-for-your-product-descriptions/" target="_blank">Write detailed product descriptions</a> to improve search rankings.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>- </strong></span>Include reassuring elements to build trust with your customer (telephone number, secure payment logos, link to your <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-anatomy-of-ecommerce-return-policies/" target="_blank">return policy</a>)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this success story, we’re introducing you to a PrestaShop store with a unique concept – “Dresses under $29”. No matter which item you select from <a href="http://www.29nunder.com/" target="_blank">29 N Under’s </a>online store, you’re guaranteed to pay no more than $29. This innovative pricing model was thought up by marketing professional and co-owner, Jason Burlin. The dress selection and creative outfits however, is curated by his wife and Californian fashionista, Oryan Burlin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18366" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/29-N-UNDER-SS-Main.png" alt="" width="540" height="284" /></p>
<p>With an eye for fashion and a great business motto, this duo started selling dresses online through a Facebook store. Since then they’ve migrated to PrestaShop, and their business has blossomed into a profitable online shop! We interviewed Jason to see how they transformed their business into a PrestaShop success story.<br />
<span id="more-18365"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">Why did you choose to migrate your store from Facebook to PrestaShop?</span></h4>
<p>We started on Facebook to test the market and see if this crazy-cool idea was even feasible. We found that there were lots of people interested in our concept and in the trendy dresses we were selling. Within half a year, we were processing 80 orders a month. It was a clear sign to us that we were growing. To capitalize on our growth, we needed a robust software and a custom designed website. <strong>This is why we migrated to PrestaShop – to grow our online business. </strong></p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">How much have you grown since opening your PrestaShop store?</span></h4>
<p>We grew from processing 80 orders per month to about 1000 orders per month. I think that’s over 1000% growth since we switched over to PrestaShop. It’s amazing to think that this started as a far-fetched idea and has turned into our main source of income. We’ve grown so much that we’ve even added more people to our team. Our husband and wife duo has grown to a <strong>team of 10</strong> full and part time employees!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">How did you get started setting up your PrestaShop store?</span></h4>
<p>We searched for a developer using Odesk and Elance. After reviewing a few developers’ portfolio and checking references, we settled on one developer. He suggested PrestaShop because it is robust yet easy to use. Since we were looking for a cost effective solution, he insisted on a software that did not burn through development hours.</p>
<p>However, the biggest deciding factor is PrestaShop’s scalability. We switched from Facebook to PrestaShop because we outgrew our first store. We need a solution that fits our needs today but doesn’t stifle our growth. Even though our store has expanded over the past two years, PrestaShop still easily handles all of our orders.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">How long did it take to set up your PrestaShop store?</span></h4>
<p>Our developer was able to get the one store up and running within a week. We were able to launch so quickly because we already had our product categories, descriptions and images from our Facebook store. The day after we launched, we came into work with an order already waiting for us. It was exciting to see how quickly our hard work was paying off!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18367" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/2-29-N-UNDER-SS-Product-Images.png" alt="" width="475" height="221" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">How was your PrestaShop store different from your Facebook store?</span></h4>
<p>With our Facebook store, we had to do quite a few things manually. The most tedious was payment processing because it required us to click off-site then back on. With PrestaShop, we were able to configure the integrated <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/8277-paypalusa.html" target="_blank">PayPal module</a> in few clicks and process orders directly from the back office. Using PrestaShop reduces the amount of manual work we had to do and saves us time -<strong> everything is streamlined</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18368" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/3-29-N-UNDER-SS-Newsletter-Sample.png" alt="" width="300" height="617" align="right" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">Did you customize your site with any modules from PrestaShop Addons?</span></h4>
<p>We’ve been running PrestaShop since v1.4 and use a few modules to allow customers to sign up for emails when products become available and add social media buttons to product pages. However, the module we use most often is the<a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/advertising-marketing-newsletter-modules/4932-newsletter-statistics.html" target="_blank"> newsletter module</a>. We send bi-weekly newsletters to feature new products and announce sales. We also send themed newsletters on major shopping holidays.</p>
<p>For example, we emailed customers during Independence Day [US], to promote patriotic apparel. In this newsletter, we specifically included apparel that were red, white or blue. Like many of our newsletters, it brought in a 10% increase in orders.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">As a marketer, what other marketing strategies do you use to drive traffic to your online store?</span></h4>
<p>We do all of our marketing through social media. Currently we’re measuring the effectiveness of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/29NUnder" target="_blank">Facebook </a>(against other social media platforms) by running a targeted promotion. It’s currently running so we have no results to share yet. We also use <a href="https://twitter.com/29nunder" target="_blank">Twitter </a>and <a href="http://instagram.com/29nunder/" target="_blank">Instagram </a>to promote both our dresses and outfits.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18371" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/4-29-N-UNDER-SS-FB-Sale.png" alt="" width="475" height="272" /></p>
<p><strong>[29 N Under has almost 100,000 Likes on Facebook and over 25,000 followers on Instagram! </strong>Additionally, their social media following actively promotes them with over <a href="https://www.facebook.com/29NUnder/likes" target="_blank">3,000 Facebook users talking about them</a> and an average of 750 Instagram users liking each picture they post.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18372" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/5-facebook-stats.png" alt="" width="428" height="290" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">How did you grow your online business? What differentiates your online store?</span></h4>
<p>Although we sell dresses for low prices, we believe in providing customers with a quality product and quality customer service. When customers ask questions, we addresses them immediately, especially through social media. If there’s anything we can do to make their experience better, we try to accommodate them. Doing so has allowed us to retain 20% of repeat customers. Even those who do not make a second purchase refer other potential customers to our site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18373" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/09/6-29-N-UNDER-SS-Customer-Service.png" alt="" width="475" height="298" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #b71683">What future plans do you have for 29 N Under?</span></h4>
<p>We would like to open a few brick and mortar stores. 3 would be ideal, in major U.S. cities. We’re also looking forward to upgrading to the <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/download" target="_blank">newest version of PrestaShop</a>. The statistics and analytics will give us great and much needed insight to which cities we sell the most to and we can aim to open stores there.</p>

It boasts 135 million daily visitors, has more traffic than LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube combined, and is only second to Facebook in driving users to a company’s website. &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-leverage-pinterest-for-your-online-store/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest is a social media platform on the rise for online businesses. It boasts 135 million daily visitors, has more traffic than LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube combined, and is only second to Facebook in driving users to a company’s website.</p>
<p>To encourage more companies to use its platform, Pinterest introduced business accounts with powerful analytics that track impressions, repins and clicks. Whether you are a Pinning master or just a newbie, we’re showing you how to leverage Pinterest for your online store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18315" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="315" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18314"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">What is Pinterest?</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://business.pinterest.com/en" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, they are “a visual discovery tool that you can use to find ideas for all your projects and interests.” In laymen terms, it’s a digital and social corkboard. Users (or in Pinterest speak, pinners) can collect (or pin) images onto curated web pages called boards. The social aspect comes into play when other pinners reuse those images by repining them onto their personal boards. Now that you’ve mastered the Pinterest language, the next step in leveraging Pinterest is with a great strategy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Define your Audience and Message</span></h2>
<p>The key to a successful strategy is knowing who you’re talking to and what you are trying to say. Pinterest users generally fall within one of these <a href="http://sociable360.blogspot.com/2012/02/pinterest-demographic-data-marketers.html" target="_blank">demographics</a>: <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/25/pinterest-user-demographics/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank">female, 25+ years old and live in a suburban area</a>. If your customers fall into one of these categories, you should already be on Pinterest. If you want to target that demographic, you should also start pinning.</p>
<p>Now that you know who you’re talking to, figure out your message and how you want to deliver it. The power behind Pinterest is the ability to compile different images and ideas to convey a brand lifestyle. Be sure your voice, message, and overall content mirrors the lifestyle you promote.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">6 Ecommerce Rules for Pinterest</span></h2>
<p>Although you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pinterest/pinterest-for-business/" target="_blank">set up your business Pinterest account</a>, you’re not quite ready to start pinning. First, we need to lay down some ground rules to maximize the effectiveness of your pins.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use relevant # to promote your pins.</li>
<li>Create your boards with a combination of original pins and repins</li>
<li>Pin at night, with peak pins at 9:00PM</li>
<li>Select images that are long because they work best with Pinterest’s layout.</li>
<li>Allows customers to easily share your products with a Pinterest Share button (a native feature in PrestaShop.)</li>
<li>Stay active. Repin, comment, or simply like other Pinner’s content to engage other pinners.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Original Content on Pinterest</span></h2>
<p>Start creating your Pinterest business profile with this image size cheat sheet from <a href="http://www.authormedia.com/the-pinterest-cheat-sheet-to-image-sizes/" target="_blank">AuthorMedia</a>.</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Profile images: 165 x 165 pixels (scaled from 600 X 600 pixels)</li>
<li>Pins in feed: 238 pixels x adjusted to height</li>
<li>Expanded pin size: 735 pixels x adjusted to height</li>
<li>Cover image: 217 x 146 pixels</li>
<li>Tiny thumbnails: 51 x 51 pixels</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Next, brand original images with a watermark that includes your online shop’s web address. Don’t put it on everything, just on beautiful location shots featuring multiple products. When you pin product images from your website, always link them directly to the product for effortless shopping. Finally, write good descriptions &#8211; do not use product SKU’s or files names like IMG_21231.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Ideas for Stunning Pinterest Boards</span></h2>
<p>Get started with these 5 ideas and examples of Pinterest boards.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">1. Products</span></h4>
<p>Use a “Featured Products” or “What’s new” board to keep customers updated about your products. <a href="http://www.gretelhome.com/" target="_blank">Gretel Home</a>, a PrestaShop housewares shop, promotes their products with a <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/gretelhome/new-at-gretel/" target="_blank">New at Gretel board</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18318" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-1-gretel-home.png" alt="" width="540" height="255" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">2. Inspiration</span></h4>
<p>What inspires you? Do you work with cool patterns or trendy muses?<a href="http://www.whatgoesaroundnyc.com/" target="_blank"> What Goes Around Comes Around NYC</a> is a PrestaShop powered, luxury goods reseller and they’ve curated some <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/wgacany/vintage-luxury-ads/" target="_blank">Vintage Luxury Ads</a> to inspire their own photo shoots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18319" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-2-wgaca.png" alt="" width="540" height="244" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">3. Color(s)</span></h4>
<p>Pinterest is very visual so use that to your advantage by curating an entire Pinterest board dedicated to color. Choose one color, two complimentary colors, or even a rainbow. Check out PrestaShop-powered <a href="http://www.condura.com.au" target="_blank">Condura’s </a><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/condura/black-white/" target="_blank">Black &amp; White board</a> for some mod-inspiration</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18320" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-3-condura.png" alt="" width="540" height="225" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">4. Collaboration</span></h4>
<p>Ask customers to help contribute to your Pinterest boards. We recently asked our merchants to submit their gorgeous PrestaShop storefronts with #ShopShot. Those shops are now curated on our <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/prestashop/of-pride-and-stores/" target="_blank">Of Pride and Stores</a> Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18321" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-4-prestashop.png" alt="" width="540" height="206" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">5. Season or Holiday</span></h4>
<p>Keep your pins current with seasons and holidays. As summer comes to an end, pin some ideas for last minute summer activities or look forward new accessories for fall. Last year<a href="https://www.donnawilson.com/" target="_blank"> Donna Wilson</a>, a PrestaShop merchant selling hand-knit goods, created a <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/donnawilsonltd/donna-wilson-christmas-gift-guide-2013/" target="_blank">Christmas Gift Guide</a> with the perfect gifts ideas for mum, dad and even your best friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18322" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/pinterest-5-donna-wilson.png" alt="" width="600" height="270" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #d0333a;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>As with all strategy, analyze your performance to measure its effectiveness. Doing so will ensure you are getting the most of your Pinterest Business Account.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, blogging has proved to be the most effective inbound marketing method for online businesses. Ecommerce sites that blog successfully are driving more relevant traffic, increasing brand awareness and creating shareable content.</p>
<p>This complete introduction to ecommerce blogging will share the fundamentals of creating a great blog and examples of online businesses that are doing it right.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18293" title="header-ecommerce-blogging" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/header-ecommerce-blogging-1024x537.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p><span id="more-18264"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Benefits of Blogging for Ecommerce</span></h2>
<p>Too many online retailers focus solely on marketing tactics that convert visitors into direct sales like discounts and promotions. And yet, blogging isn’t about converting customers right away. It’s about engaging potential customers with valuable, relevant content.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Why you should blog for your business:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Appealing to your target audience<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Driving qualified traffic<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Promoting products without being salesy<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Building credibility as an expert<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Generating leads by instilling trust<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Enabling readers to share content</p>
<p>Now, how do you create a successful blog that lets you reap all of those benefits?</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Defining Buyer Personas</span></h2>
<p>An ecommerce blog is a great medium for generating traffic but savvy business owners know that tons of traffic doesn’t always mean tons of sales. You should write content that appeals to your buyer personas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-18298" title="Buyer Persona" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/Buyer-Persona.png" alt="" width="540" height="236" /></p>
<p>Buyer personas are a crucial step to be able to write killer content for your blog. That’s why you should ask yourself these <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30907/9-Questions-You-Need-to-Ask-When-Developing-Buyer-Personas.aspx" target="_blank">9 questions when developing your buyer personas</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve defined your customers, you’ll find it much easier to make a return on your blogging efforts and create the ultimate content strategy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Creating a Content Strategy</span></h2>
<p>A content strategy will determine the type of content, tone, topics and information you’ll publish to engage prospective buyers.</p>
<p>Because buyer personas play such a large role when developing a content strategy, there isn’t one approach that works for every ecommerce blog. However, there are best practices that are working for many successful businesses regardless of what they are selling.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">Engaging blog content ideas for inspiration:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> How-to videos<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Photo heavy content<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Do it yourself articles<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Outfit inspiration<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Holiday gift ideas<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Interviews with celebrated leaders<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Review or predict trends<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Showcase your team, office, etc<br />
<strong><span style="color: #e74c3c;">-</span></strong> Review related services, products, events</p>
<p>Always remember that your blog should build trust, provide information and increase brand awareness with content that converts readers and/or keeps them coming back for more.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Building an Editorial Calendar</span></h2>
<p>Every active blog has an editorial calendar running behind the scenes. A monthly editorial calendar is a document that manages the planning, creation and publishing of blog posts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18299" title="EDITORIAL CALENDAR" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/EDITORIAL-CALENDAR.png" alt="" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">A comprehensive editorial calendar includes:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Publish Date:</strong></span> That’s pretty self explanatory but make sure you consider holidays, days of the week and timing. This article covers the <a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2011/06/10/whats-the-best-day-and-time-to-publish-content/  " target="_blank">best days and times to publish content</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Title:</strong></span> Blog post titles should be SEO-friendly but most importantly, they should tempt your buyer persona to read.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>SEO Keywords:</strong></span> These are the keywords you want to use throughout the blog post to rank higher on search engines. Here are <a href="http://writtent.com/blog/14-blog-writing-tips-for-creating-seo-friendly-blog-posts/ " target="_blank">14 tips for writing SEO-friendly blog posts</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Call to Action:</strong></span> Every blog post should have a clear call to action. What exactly do you want your readers to do after reading this post? Like your Facebook page, view a product, watch a video?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"><strong>Channels for Promotion:</strong></span> How will you promote this blog post to readers? For example, you might share the blog post on social networks or in your monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>Soon you’ll see that an editorial calendar is an indispensible tool for planning and executing a great content strategy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1abc9c;">Who’s Doing It Right?</span></h2>
<p>You’re just about ready to start blogging! There’s just one last step. Take a look at the blogs of your competitors to assess what they’re doing right and what you’ll do better.</p>
<p>For your own inspiration, here are 3 ecommerce businesses that are blogging successfully:</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3498db;">#1 Target.com</span></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18300" title="#1 A Bullseye View" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/1-A-Bullseye-View.png" alt="" width="570" height="392" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Bootstrap is no longer a buzzword in web-design. It has become a full-fledged action verb. “Are you having trouble starting your web-design project? Just Bootstrap it.” When a brand name like Twitter Bootstrap becomes an informal everyday word, you know that people like it and that people use it, a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">In the likes Xerox for photocopying, and Google for online searching, Bootstrap has essentially become the go-to framework for designing websites. That may be a bit of a bold statement given the number of competitors in the market, but hear me out. In my previous post, I gave <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/what-is-bootstrap/">a brief history of the unlikely birth and explosive hype</a> surrounding the Twitter Bootstrap framework.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look into 5 reasons why Bootstrap has matched the hype.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18251" title="img-02" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/08/img-02.png" alt="" width="500" height="150" /><span id="more-18245"></span></p>
<h4>1. Time Saver:</h4>
<p>Bootstrap comes equipped with pre-made grids, patterns, and ready-to-go CSS and HTML style elements like tables, forms, buttons, icons etc. What does this mean for the busy web-designer? It means that you literally have everything you need to create a professional looking website from scratch, all with one package of Bootstrap. Gone are the days where you have to style and code every element of your webpage, just Bootstrap it.</p>
<h4>2. Fully Responsive:</h4>
<p>Nearly all websites need to be mobile ready and responsive, especially ecommerce websites. You want your visitors to be able to browse products on a desktop at home, add products on their tablet while waiting to board a plane, and complete checkout on their smartphone after landing. It happens more and more each day as the power of mobile design and mobile payments evolve. Bootstrap comes ready with a variety of responsive grids to service every level of mobile ready design.</p>
<h4>3. Active Community:</h4>
<p>To date, <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap’s GitHub repository</a> has 70,000 stars (which equate to Facebook likes, or Google +1’s). It also has nearly 600 contributors making it one of the most popular repositories on GitHub. You can be sure that if you ever have a problem, concern or question, simply post the question on GitHub Bootstrap threads and interact with the experts. Chances are, your question has been answered already. It’s good to know the community has got your back.</p>
<h4>4. JavaScript Plugin Bundles:</h4>
<p>One of Bootstrap’s greatest features is that it comes pre-bundled with a variety of useful JavaScript plugins. Every designer knows the headache that can come with compatibility between JavaScript functions and your web-design. Fortunately, all of Bootstraps pre-bundled JS plugins work flawlessly. Do you need animated tabs, moving sliders and collapsible menus? Just Bootstrap it.</p>
<h4>5. Docs. Docs. Docs:</h4>
<p>One can never underestimate the power of good documentation. Bootstrap is heralded around the web-design world for having extensive, helpful and easy-to-read documentation. They provide examples of nearly every element. I can’t forget to mention that it also includes a demo that makes it even more accessible for the beginner web-designer. From the easiest functions to the most complex elements, the Bootstrap documentation covers all bases.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Bootstrap exploded through the web-design scene and it’s no surprise why. The combination of ready-made elements, bundled animations, extensive documentation and a passionate community make the Twitter Bootstrap framework an attractive solution for all levels of web-design. That’s not to say you’ll have your dream website in a snap, you still must have a pretty good knowledge of HTML and CSS to really get started. If you haven’t seen it already, we were fortunate enough to interview the creator of Bootstrap, Mark Otto.
